### Motivation
In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by ordersof magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvementin real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and pre-clude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. 

### Overview 
We present
ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering
in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain.
Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device
say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power
as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive
APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and
power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems
by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to
provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very
low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs
can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real
active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore,
we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMOâ€™s smart surface for
each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome
random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our
evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi
(11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median
throughput improvement of 2x over the active AP alone.
