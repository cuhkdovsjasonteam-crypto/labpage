      <p>
       Perception is the capability of a system to organize and interpret sensory data to represent and understand the underlying information. Much of the perception relies on multi-modal sensing, while the building principles of perception, such as learning and identifying patterns, apply across the visual spectrum, text, audio, and more recently, wireless signals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the field of computer vision becomes increasingly more refined and practical, the scope of research efforts is also growing to undertake more challenging problems, often those that would benefit from the incorporation of additional modalities to have a crucial impact on our daily lives. Applications such as monitoring people and spaces are now within reach of visual perception methods that can effectively extend beyond photons of the visible spectrum to wireless signals of the electromagnetic waves traveling through the air. Hence, there is an increasing interest in the computer vision community establishing interdisciplinary research lines to analyze and leverage wireless sensory data in a growing number of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In stark contrast to existing sensing modalities such as color or infrared images, wireless data based upon <font class="important">5G, WiFi, millimeter waves</font>, and <font class="important">radar</font> allow for the perception of the environment, changes, and 3D structure of static or dynamic scenes through absolute darkness, through occluders, walls and around corners. Even subtle and distant motions invisible to cameras, such as heart rate and respiration, can be perceived through the electromagnetic field. Wireless systems are already an integral part of mobile devices and network access points in many households and offices. Using radio frequencies as a new type of camera allows improving existing algorithms developed in computer vision and machine learning for photometric images and facilitates inventing an entirely new generation of solutions that use wireless signals to their full potential for widespread applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        The objective of this workshop is to highlight cutting-edge approaches and recent progress in the growing field of joint wireless perception using machine learning and possibly also other modalities such as images. It will allow researchers and companies in wireless perception to present their progress and discuss novel ideas that will shape the future of this area.

		<p>This paper demonstrates high-resolution imaging using millimeter wave (mmWave) radars that can function even in dense fog. We leverage the fact that mmWave signals have favorable propagation characteristics in low visibil- ity conditions, unlike optical sensors like cameras and Li- DARs which cannot penetrate through dense fog. Millime- ter wave radars, however, suffer from very low resolution, specularity, and noise artifacts. We introduce HawkEye, a system that leverages a cGAN architecture to recover high-frequency shapes from raw low-resolution mmWave heatmaps. We propose a novel design that addresses chal- lenges specific to the structure and nature of the radar sig- nals involved. We also develop a data synthesizer to aid with large-scale dataset generation for training. We implement our system on a custom-built mmWave radar platform and demonstrate performance improvement over both standard mmWave radars and other competitive baselines.

		<p>Mobile autonomous systems have gained significant momentum in recent years due to their growing impact on a variety of smart city applications, such as autonomous vehicles, digital twins, smart manufacturing processes, warehousing and logistics, to name a few. However, such systems have been successfully demonstrated mostly in benign and controlled environments. In this talk I will focus on the next generation of autonomous mobile systems designed to handle adverse and dynamically changing conditions, such as darkness, smoke and bad weather. I will discuss key research challenges motivating the development of novel robust localisation and mapping techniques, and will explore emerging approaches to human robot interaction.

		<p>The next big deal for Wi-Fi is not about communication and networking, but sensing. Wireless Sensing technology is turning a Wi-Fi device into a ubiquitous sensor, which not only adds a brand new dimension to the functions, capabilities, and applications of all Wi-Fi systems, but also revolutionizes how sensing, especially human-centric sensing, is practiced. Wi-Fi Sensing utilizes ambient Wi-Fi signals to analyze and interpret human and object movements, underpinning many sensing applications such as motion sensing, sleep monitoring, fall detection,
etc. These new sensing functionalities can benefit the global Wi-Fi ecosystem including integrated circuit manufacturers, device manufacturers, system integrators, application developers, and ultimately end users. In this talk, we introduce the concepts, principles of Wi-Fi Sensing, and share our unique technologies that have been deployed for real-world applications. We foresee that Wi-Fi Sensing will enter billions of devices and millions of homes, creating a smarter space for a smarter life.

		<p>5G wireless communications are the enabler for new advanced use cases, such as mobile AR/VR, cloud gaming, wireless industrial automation,  made possible by the higher achievable throughputs, lower latency and higher reliability. Wireless devices are also more and more equipped with several advanced sensor and perception algorithms. In this presentation, I will discuss how wireless transmissions can be used for improving perception, and vice-versa, how perception can be used for improving 5G communications.

		<p>Wi-Fi devices are all around us, not just in smartphones but other IoT devices like smart-watches, smart-home appliances or smart sensors. With these Wi-Fi-connected devices increasing by the day, it becomes cumbersome to keep a tab on all of them manually, and GPS is not accurate enough to keep track of these devices indoors. Due to this widespread deployment of Wi-Fi and lack of GPS indoors, Wi-Fi-based localization for Indoor appliances becomes a necessity and requirement.
Current localization algorithms are tested on either too sparse data or use large datasets to fingerprint most of the locations. Furthermore, each algorithm is tested against its own data which makes coming up with a baseline really hard. This has further led to minimal to no deployment of about two decades of Wi-Fi localization into real-world systems. On the other hand, your smartphones are already using high-end computer vision algorithms that have been developed only in the last decade, all due to open-source competitions like ImageNet. 
To that extent, we are open-sourcing our datasets and are present our Kaggle competition that can be accessed <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/wild-v2">here</a>.

		<p>Wi-Fi imaging has attracted significant interest due to the ubiquitous availability of Wi-Fi devices today. In this talk, I will introduce Wi-Fi See It All (WiSIA), a versatile Wi-Fi imaging system built upon commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. Based on a dataset, I will explain how WiSIA constructs the image plane with two pairs of transceivers and 2D-IFFT and how WiSIA extracts the specific physical signature of the signals reflected from multiple objects to segment their boundaries. In addition, I will demonstrate some evaluation results of object segmentation by using such a Wi-Fi imaging technique.

		<p>Open datasets are essential to provide comprehensive knowledge for model training and a unified benchmark for model comparison. Open datasets are even more necessary in the wireless sensing field because RF signals are more sensitive to devices and deployment environments. However, the absence of high-quality and large-scale datasets has become the bottleneck that hindered the progress of wireless sensing technology. Existing wireless sensing datasets suffer from small scales and limited scenarios in 2019 when we started to build the Widar3 dataset. Widar3 is a wireless sensing dataset for human activity recognition. It is collected from commodity Wi-Fi NICs in the form of RSSI and CSI. It consists of 258,000 instances of hand gestures with a duration of 8,620 minutes and from 75 domains. Widar3 is so far the largest and most comprehensive dataset in this field and receives widespread attention from researchers all over the world. Widar3 dataset is publicly available at IEEE DataPort (official data repository) and continues evolving to contain more types of activities. This talk will introduce Widar3 dataset and provide a tutorial for starting wireless AI research with it.
