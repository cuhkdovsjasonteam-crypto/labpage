 Transceivers via a Single-Side-Band QPSK Backscatter
 Communication Technique"

  description: "More portable, fully wireless smart home setups. Lower power wearables. Batteryless smart devices. These could all be made possible thanks to a new ultra-low power Wi-Fi radio developed by electrical engineers at the University of California San Diego. 
The device, which is housed in a chip smaller than a grain of rice, enables Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate with existing Wi-Fi networks using 5,000 times less power than today’s Wi-Fi radios. It consumes just 28 microwatts of power. And it does so while transmitting data at a rate of 2 megabits per second (a connection fast enough to stream music and most YouTube videos) over a range of up to 21 meters."

- title: "ScatterMIMO: Enabling Virtual MIMO with Smart Surfaces"
  image: scattermimo.png
  description: "In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial
multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders
of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement
in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude
effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present
ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering
in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain.
Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device
say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power
as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive
APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and
power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems
by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to
provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very
low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs
can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real
active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore,
we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO’s smart surface for
each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome
random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our
evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi
(11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median
throughput improvement of 2x over the active AP alone."

- title: "Deep Learning based Wireless Localization for Indoor Navigation"
  image: dloc.png
  description: Location services, fundamentally, rely on two components- a mapping system and a positioning system. The mapping system provides the physical map of the space, and the positioning system identifies the position within the map. Outdoor location services have thrived over the last couple of decades because of well-establishedplatforms for both these components (e.g. Google Maps for mapping, and GPS for positioning). In contrast, indoor location services haven’t caught up because of the lack of reliable mapping and positioning frameworks, as GPS is known not to work indoors. WiFi positioning lacks maps and is also prone to environmental errors. In this paper, we present DLoc, a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). DLoc uses data from the mapping platform we developed, MapFind, that can construct location-tagged maps of the environment. Together, they allow off-the-shelf WiFi devices like smartphones toaccess a map of the environment and to estimate their position withrespect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 120 thousand points under 10 different scenarios across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WiFi-based localizationby 80% (median and 90th percentile) across the 2000 sq. ft. spanningtwo different spaces.

- title: "LocAP: Accurate Localization of Existing WiFi Infrastructure"
  image: loc_ap.png
  description: Indoor localization has been studied for nearly two decades fueled by wide interest in indoor navigation, achieving the necessary decimeter-level accuracy. However, there are no real-world deployments of WiFi-based user localization algorithms, primarily because these algorithms are triangulation based and therefore assume the location of the Access Points, their antenna geometries, and deployment orientations in the physical map. In the real world, such detailed knowledge of the location attributes of the Access Point is seldom available, thereby making WiFi localization hard to deploy. In this paper, for the first time, we establish the accuracy requirements for the location attributes of access points to achieve decimeter level user localization accuracy. Surprisingly, these requirements for antenna geometries and deployment orientation are very stringent, requiring millimeter level and sub-10 degree of accuracy respectively, which is hard to achieve with manual effort. To ease the deployment of real-world WiFi localization, we present LocAP, which is an autonomous system to physically map the environment and accurately locate the attributes of existing infrastructure AP in the physical space down to the required stringent accuracy of 3 mm antenna separation and 3degree deployment orientation median errors, whereas state-of-the-art report 150 mm and 25degrees respectively.

  image: capttery.png
  description: Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are becoming widely adopted, but they increasingly suffer from limited power, as power cords cannot reach the billions and batteries do not last forever. Existing systems address the issue with ultra-low-power designs and energy scavenging, which inevitably limit functionality. To unlock the full potential of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, our solution uses capacitive power transfer (CPT) to provide battery-like wireless power delivery, henceforth referred to as "Capttery". Capttery presents the first room-level (~5 m) CPT system, which delivers continuous milliwatt-level wireless power to multiple IoT devices concurrently. Unlike conventional one-to-one CPT systems that target kilowatt power in a controlled and potentially hazardous setup, Capttery is designed to be human-safe and invariant in a practical and dynamic environment. Our evaluation shows that Capttery can power end-to-end IoT applications across a typical room, where new receivers can be easily added in a plug-and-play manner.

  image: sparSDR.png
  description: "We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto."

  image: sweepsense.png
  description: "Wireless transmissions occur intermittently across the entire spectrum. For example, WiFi and Bluetooth devices transmit frames across the 100 MHz-wide 2.4 GHz band, and LTE devices transmit frames between 700 MHz and 3.7 GHz). Today, only high-cost radios can sense across the spectrum with sufficient temporal resolution to observe these individual transmissions. We present “SweepSense”, a low-cost radio architecture that senses the entire spectrum with high-temporal resolution by rapidly sweeping across it. Sweeping introduces new challenges for spectrum sensing: SweepSense radios only capture a small number of distorted samples of transmissions. To overcome this challenge, we correct the distortion with self-generated calibration data, and classify the protocol that originated each transmission with only a fraction of the transmission’s samples. We demonstrate that SweepSense can accurately identify four protocols transmitting simultaneously in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. We also demonstrate that it can simultaneously monitor the load of several LTE base stations operating in disjoint bands."

  image: signet.png
  description: "Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction. Our code will be made available <a href='https://github.com/mengyuest/SIGNet'>online</a>"

  image: bloc.png
  description: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags have become very prevalent over the last decade for tracking applications in homes as well as businesses. These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

  image: movr.png
  description: "Today’s virtual reality (VR) headsets require a cable connection to a PC or game console. This cable significantly
limits the player’s mobility and, hence, her VR experience. The high data rate requirement of this link (multiple Gbps) precludes its replacement by WiFi. Thus, in
this paper, we focus on using mmWave technology to deliver multi-Gbps wireless communication between VR
headsets and their game consoles. We address the two
key problems that prevent existing mmWave links from
being used in VR systems. First, mmWave signals suffer from a blockage problem, i.e., they operate mainly
in line-of-sight and can be blocked by simple obstacles
such as the player lifting her hand in front of the headset.
Second, mmWave radios use highly directional antennas
with very narrow beams; they work only when the transmitter’s beam is aligned with the receiver’s beam. Any
small movement of the headset can break the alignment
and stall the data stream. We present MoVR, a novel
system that allows mmWave links to sustain high data
rates even in the presence of a blockage and mobility.
MoVR does this by introducing a smart mmWave mirror and leveraging VR headset tracking information. We
implement MoVR and empirically demonstrate its performance using an HTC VR headset."

802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter,
and the backscattered signals can then be decoded as a standard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. HitchHike’s key invention is a novel technique called codeword
translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its
information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another
valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver
to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors
for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We
show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink
throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and
ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around

even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas.
Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our
experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show
that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath."

accurately localize even when the target device is stationary.
This expands the application scenarios of SpotOn indoor localization system beyond localizing mobile devices carried by

WiFi OFDM communication. SpotOn owes its accuracy to
its super-resolution algorithms to estimate the direction of
the target device and novel triangulation algorithms which
combine measurements from different WiFi access points to
estimate the location of the transmitter.
We implemented SpotOn using commercial off-the-shelf

measurement, we describe novel circuits and algorithms that
can be added to existing radios to enable them to accurately
and concurrently receive and disentangle their own transmissions’ reflections and infer its properties."

  description: "This paper presents the design and implementation of the first in-band full duplex WiFi radios that can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel using standard WiFi 802.11ac PHYs and achieves close to the theoretical doubling of throughput in all practical deployment scenarios. Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice."

  description: "This paper presents a full duplex radio design using signal inversion
and adaptive cancellation. Signal inversion uses a simple design
based on a balanced/unbalanced (Balun) transformer. This new design, unlike prior work, supports wideband and high power systems. In theory, this new design has no limitation on bandwidth or
power. In practice, we find that the signal inversion technique alone
can cancel at least 45dB across a 40MHz bandwidth. Further, combining signal inversion cancellation with cancellation in the digital
domain can reduce self-interference by up to 73dB for a 10MHz
OFDM signal."
