  image: capttery.png
  description: Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are becoming widely adopted, but they increasingly suffer from limited power, as power cords cannot reach the billions and batteries do not last forever. Existing systems address the issue with ultra-low-power designs and energy scavenging, which inevitably limit functionality. To unlock the full potential of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, our solution uses capacitive power transfer (CPT) to provide battery-like wireless power delivery, henceforth referred to as "Capttery". Capttery presents the first room-level (~5 m) CPT system, which delivers continuous milliwatt-level wireless power to multiple IoT devices concurrently. Unlike conventional one-to-one CPT systems that target kilowatt power in a controlled and potentially hazardous setup, Capttery is designed to be human-safe and invariant in a practical and dynamic environment. Our evaluation shows that Capttery can power end-to-end IoT applications across a typical room, where new receivers can be easily added in a plug-and-play manner.

- title: "SparSDR: Sparsity-proportional Backhaul and Compute for SDRs"
  image: sparSDR.png
  description: "We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto."

  image: sweepsense.png
  description: "Wireless transmissions occur intermittently across the entire spectrum. For example, WiFi and Bluetooth devices transmit frames across the 100 MHz-wide 2.4 GHz band, and LTE devices transmit frames between 700 MHz and 3.7 GHz). Today, only high-cost radios can sense across the spectrum with sufficient temporal resolution to observe these individual transmissions. We present “SweepSense”, a low-cost radio architecture that senses the entire spectrum with high-temporal resolution by rapidly sweeping across it. Sweeping introduces new challenges for spectrum sensing: SweepSense radios only capture a small number of distorted samples of transmissions. To overcome this challenge, we correct the distortion with self-generated calibration data, and classify the protocol that originated each transmission with only a fraction of the transmission’s samples. We demonstrate that SweepSense can accurately identify four protocols transmitting simultaneously in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. We also demonstrate that it can simultaneously monitor the load of several LTE base stations operating in disjoint bands."

  image: signet.png
  description: "Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction. Our code will be made available <a href='https://github.com/mengyuest/SIGNet'>online</a>"

- title: "BLoc: CSI-based accurate localization for BLE tags"
  image: bloc.png
  description: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags have become very prevalent over the last decade for tracking applications in homes as well as businesses. These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

  description: "This paper presents the design and implementation of the first in-band full duplex WiFi radios that can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel using standard WiFi 802.11ac PHYs and achieves close to the theoretical doubling of throughput in all practical deployment scenarios. Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice."
