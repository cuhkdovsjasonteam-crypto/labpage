  image: capttery.png
  description: Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are becoming widely adopted, but they increasingly suffer from limited power, as power cords cannot reach the billions and batteries do not last forever. Existing systems address the issue with ultra-low-power designs and energy scavenging, which inevitably limit functionality. To unlock the full potential of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, our solution uses capacitive power transfer (CPT) to provide battery-like wireless power delivery, henceforth referred to as "Capttery". Capttery presents the first room-level (~5 m) CPT system, which delivers continuous milliwatt-level wireless power to multiple IoT devices concurrently. Unlike conventional one-to-one CPT systems that target kilowatt power in a controlled and potentially hazardous setup, Capttery is designed to be human-safe and invariant in a practical and dynamic environment. Our evaluation shows that Capttery can power end-to-end IoT applications across a typical room, where new receivers can be easily added in a plug-and-play manner.

  image: sparSDR.png
  description: "We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto."

  image: sweepsense.png
  description: "Wireless transmissions occur intermittently across the entire spectrum. For example, WiFi and Bluetooth devices transmit frames across the 100 MHz-wide 2.4 GHz band, and LTE devices transmit frames between 700 MHz and 3.7 GHz). Today, only high-cost radios can sense across the spectrum with sufficient temporal resolution to observe these individual transmissions. We present “SweepSense”, a low-cost radio architecture that senses the entire spectrum with high-temporal resolution by rapidly sweeping across it. Sweeping introduces new challenges for spectrum sensing: SweepSense radios only capture a small number of distorted samples of transmissions. To overcome this challenge, we correct the distortion with self-generated calibration data, and classify the protocol that originated each transmission with only a fraction of the transmission’s samples. We demonstrate that SweepSense can accurately identify four protocols transmitting simultaneously in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. We also demonstrate that it can simultaneously monitor the load of several LTE base stations operating in disjoint bands."

  image: signet.png
  description: "Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction. Our code will be made available <a href='https://github.com/mengyuest/SIGNet'>online</a>"

  image: bloc.png
  description: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags have become very prevalent over the last decade for tracking applications in homes as well as businesses. These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

  image: movr.png
  description: "Today’s virtual reality (VR) headsets require a cable connection to a PC or game console. This cable significantly
limits the player’s mobility and, hence, her VR experience. The high data rate requirement of this link (multiple Gbps) precludes its replacement by WiFi. Thus, in
this paper, we focus on using mmWave technology to deliver multi-Gbps wireless communication between VR
headsets and their game consoles. We address the two
key problems that prevent existing mmWave links from
being used in VR systems. First, mmWave signals suffer from a blockage problem, i.e., they operate mainly
in line-of-sight and can be blocked by simple obstacles
such as the player lifting her hand in front of the headset.
Second, mmWave radios use highly directional antennas
with very narrow beams; they work only when the transmitter’s beam is aligned with the receiver’s beam. Any
small movement of the headset can break the alignment
and stall the data stream. We present MoVR, a novel
system that allows mmWave links to sustain high data
rates even in the presence of a blockage and mobility.
MoVR does this by introducing a smart mmWave mirror and leveraging VR headset tracking information. We
implement MoVR and empirically demonstrate its performance using an HTC VR headset."

  description: "We present HitchHike, a low power backscatter system that

802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter,
and the backscattered signals can then be decoded as a standard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. HitchHike’s key invention is a novel technique called codeword
translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its
information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another
valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver
to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors
for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We
show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink
throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and
ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around

an accurate indoor localization system that can be deployed

not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves
the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems.
SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi
incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately
compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components
even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas.
Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our
experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show
that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath."

new algorithms that separate out the moving backscatter from the clutter that static reflectors produce and then

SpotOn does not require any software or hardware modifications at the access points or the radio that needs to be

accurately localize even when the target device is stationary.
This expands the application scenarios of SpotOn indoor localization system beyond localizing mobile devices carried by
humans. SpotOn achieves localization using Channel State
Information (CSI) calculated for each packet during regular
WiFi OFDM communication. SpotOn owes its accuracy to
its super-resolution algorithms to estimate the direction of
the target device and novel triangulation algorithms which
combine measurements from different WiFi access points to
estimate the location of the transmitter.
We implemented SpotOn using commercial off-the-shelf
Intel 5300 WiFi NICs. SpotOn achieves localization accuracy of 0.6 m when the target device has significant number
