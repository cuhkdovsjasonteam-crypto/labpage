        <p align="justify">The mmNets workshop is focused on the design and implementation of new algorithms, protocols and systems for communication, networking and systems in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands. The scope of the workshop ranges from new ultra-broadband networks, which can enable multi-Gbps and even Tbps throughput, ultra-low latency, and reliable wireless connectivity for beyond 5G and 6G cellular systems and wireless LANs, to new sensing systems with unprecedented resolution and innovative features enabled by the electromagnetic properties of radiation above 100 GHz. The workshop will bring together researchers from devices, communications and signal processing, wireless networking, and mobile and sensing applications to set the future research agenda of mmWave and THz systems, and present innovative ideas that will help realize the vision of extremely high data rate, ultra-low latency, and reliable mmWave networks and novel advanced sensing applications.</p>

        <p align="justify">We solicit papers with original unpublished ideas in mmWave and THz networks and sensing systems. Also, we solicit submissions with novel results in experimental platforms, system measurements, and prototypes. Submissions will be judged by their technical merit through a peer-review process by the Technical Program Committee.</p>

        <br/> -->

        <!-- <h3 class="section-title multiple-title">Poster/Demo</h3>
        <p align="justify">You can also present a poster or demo of your work. Demos and poster submissions should consist of a one-page abstract in the same format describing the demonstration plan or the outline of the poster content. <b>We encourage students with a paper, poster, or demo at ACM MobiCom to present their work at S<sup>3</sup> as well</b>. We will be awarding a cash prize for the best poster/demo.
        The title of these papers must bear a "Poster:"/"Demo:" prefix.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title multiple-title">Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Competition</h3>
        <p align="justify">3MT is developed by The University of Queensland for showcasing research done by PhD reseachers. 3MT cultivates students’ academic, presentation, and research communication skills.
          The competition supports their capacity to effectively explain their research in three minutes, in a language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Participating in 3MT develops academic, presentation and research communication skills, while developing research candidates’ ability to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Plus, it comes with the opportunity to win prizes!.</p>
          <p align="justify">
		The title of these papers must bear a "3MT:" prefix and should be a one-page abstract with the same format for paper submission.
          
          Contestants should prepare a one-slide presentation of the topic they plan to present for maximum of 3 minutes during the ACM S3 3MT competition. You should adhere to the standard 3MT competition rules listed
          <a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/competition-rules" target="_blank">here</a>.

          We will be using the standard judging criteria for 3MT competition at ACM S3 which can be accessed <a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/judging-criteria-and-panel" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <!-- <h3 class="section-title multiple-title">Panel discussions</h3>
        <p align="justify">Our panel discussions' format focuses on the Q&A style that we encourage more questions asked
          from the student audience. There will be a shortlist of curated questions from the moderator, and most importantly, we
          aim to allocate most of the time to the student audiences' questions. </p>
          <ul>Virtual vs in-person conferences from a student perspective: </ul>
          <ul>Academia or industry: what to consider while making the decision </ul>
          <ul>Importance of Artifacts and re-producibility of research </ul>
          <ul>How to use AI-chat tools in research and teaching </ul>
          <br>


        <p align="justify"><i>TPC members are also invited to propose potential talks. While the program committee and presentors will be restricted to current graduate students, we encourage all members of the wireless/mobile computing community to attend and participate.</i></p> -->
